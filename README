Vertical Response for Rails
===========================

A simple module to push members and newsletters to
pre-created lists in the Vertical Response Email Campaign Application (verticalresponse.com).


Required Gems
=============
- soap4r

Recreating WSDL files
=====================
If the WSDL files are out-of-date, run the following script to recreate them, and place them in the lib folder (replacing the older versions of the files):
  ruby  /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/soap4r-1.5.8/bin/wsdl2ruby.rb \n
        --wsdl https://api.verticalresponse.com/wsdl/1.0/VRAPI.wsdl --type client --force

Add a Certs directory to config
================================
If you want to use a certificate with the API, add a certs folder in the config directory.
The VR_CERT, and VR_KEY options set the file names for the cert and key. The plugin will look
in the certs folder for these files.

Place and modify in environment.rb
==================================
# Vertical Response Settings
VR_USERNAME = ""
VR_PASSWORD = ""
VR_SESSION_TIME = 4 
# VR SESSION TIME determines how many minutes until the session id expires
VR_REDIRECT = "http://www.verticalresponse.com"
VR_CERT = ""
VR_KEY  = ""
VR_WSDL = "https://api.verticalresponse.com/partner-wsdl/1.0/VRAPI.wsdl" 
# VR_WSDL is set to the partner WSDL. The Enterprise WSDL url is "https://api.verticalresponse.com/wsdl/1.0/VRAPI.wsdl"


# Vertical Response List IDs
# Define the List Ids you will use (optional)
TEST_LIST_ID = ""


Example
=======

This plugin creates a simple class that you can use to connect to a VR list and 
push members or newsletters into it.
